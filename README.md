# Communicating Climate Change: A Data Science Project

**Abstract**: 
This project, a collaboration between
Aalto University and Reaktor, is focused
on the problem of communicating climate
change to a predominantly Nordic
audience. It achieved this by building
interactive and exploratory visualizations
to let people explore the data and by
publishing them on a public website.
Additionally, a simple multivariate linear
regression model was built to predict
emissions five years into the future which
made decently plausible predictions
