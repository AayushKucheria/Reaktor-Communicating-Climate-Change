Climate change, mainly due to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane emissions, is one of the largest challenges that humanity is currently facing. 
As population and consumption will continue to increase in the future, so will emissions. Meaning the challenge is far from over and will 
likely get worse before getting better. 

If not addressed and limited, climate change will cause widespread social, economic and ecosystem damage. 
As greenhouse gas emissions are distributed globally and over a wide range of societal activities, it needs to be addressed from a 
global point of view. 

The political goal of limiting global warming caused by emissions to 1,5 degrees has risen. It has been assessed that this would require a 
general global carbon neutrality by 2050 and negative emission soon after that. 
 
While that goal is still far from achieved there is an increasing momentum of decreasing emissions. Europe as an example has been able to 
cut its total emissions almost yearly since the 1990s. In addition, several countries both within and outside of Europe have pledged 
carbon neutrality with varying target years. 
 
In the Glasgow climate conference in November of 2021 a new global agreement, the Glasgow Climate Pact, was reached. In the agreement the 
countries pledged to cut the emission of CO2 to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. On a better note, for the first time, there was an 
explicit plan to reduce the use of coal by phasing it down. The pact pledged to increase financial aid to developing countries to help them 
cope with both the effects of climate change and the switch to clean energy.

  Human-induced global warming reached about 1¬∞C (likely between 0.8 and 1.2¬∞C) above pre-industrial levels in 2017, with a 0.2¬∞C increase per decade. 
  Most land regions are warming up faster than the global average - depending on the considered temperature dataset, 20-40% of the world population 
  live in regions that had already experienced warming of more than 1.5¬∞C in at least one season by the decade 2006-2015. 

  Global warming is defined in the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report as an increase in combined surface air and 
  sea surface temperatures averaged over the globe and a 30-year period, usually relative to the period 1850-1900. By that measure, warming 
  from pre-industrial levels to the decade 2006-2015 is assessed to be approximately 0.87¬∞C.  
  
  The red line in the figure above shows the global temperature over the previous 30 years while the straight lines represent a 1 ¬∞C and 1.5 ¬∞C 
  increase from pre-industrial levels. Note that the figure is merely an approximation for the sake of visualization: in practice, there is no 
  exact pre-industrial temperature to work with - even the methods of calculating it differ greatly - and therefore also no exact temperature we 
  could label as 1.5 ¬∞C increase.

  Global emissions can be grouped according to their source sectors. One way to do this is the following where 4 different sources are

  Energy related emission, agriculture, forestry, and land use related emissions, industrial process related emissions and waste related emissions.  

  As mentioned of these sectors, energy is with 73,2% the largest source of emissions. 54% of energy related emissions come from energy in industry, 
  22,1% from transportation, and 23,9% from energy usage in buildings both commercial and residential. Transportation related emissions are mainly 
  from roads. This is visible in the figure above as the circles are relative to the proportion of total emissions. 

  The remaining 26,8% of the emissions are as following: 18,4% of emissions come from agriculture, forestry & land use which mainly consists 
  of livestock, manure, rice cultivation, agricultural soils, and crop related emissions. Industrial processes, cement and chemical & petrochemical,
